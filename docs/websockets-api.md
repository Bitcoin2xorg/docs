# eToroX Websockets API

eToroX WebSocket streaming servers offers real-time market data updates and user specific data.

WebSockets is a bidirectional protocol offering fastest real-time data, helping you build real-time applications.

> eToroX provides streaming services via Websockets only to identified users.

## General

* The base endpoint is provided by the UI website when creating a developer app.
* All websocket messages are JSON fromatted messages spearated with a special space like character `` (`0x1e`) .
* eToroX wll close Websockets that are opened for more than 24 hours, it's most recommended to preform gradual recycle of new Websockets connection before hard disconnection from eToroX server side.

## Ping
Both eToroX and it's client would like to determine whether connection is alive.
> The described `ping` is an application layer ping, it's in addition to the Websocket protocol ping which is initiated by the server.

User must send a `ping` frames every ~15 seconds.

Client connections are terminated if no valid ping is received for over 30 seconds.
If eToroX server will not respond with a valid `ping` result that client should assume eToroX server is not accessible.

> When using [SignalR](signal-r) it's transparently managed by the SignalR client.

## Rate limit

eToroX will update here the limits of creating websockets

## Server side connection hangups

Other from connectivity issues eToroX server will terminate client connections in any of the folllowing scenarios:

* Client didn't preform the `setup` action properly.
* Client didn't preform the http handshake in time.
* Client, after completing the http handshake didn't immediately complete the `setup` action.
* Client didn't ping the server in a proper timeframe.

## Websocket protocol

Any Websocket complaint (`rfc6455`) client should be able to connect to eToroX streaming services.

Currently users can choose one of the following clients for integration:
* [SignalR](signal-r) (Cross platform ASP.NET Core SignalR) - The easiest approach, SignalR will handle for the user most parts of the transport protocol leaving the user only with eToroX actions.
* Websocket - User will need to handle all of the transport protocol actions in addition to eToroX actions.

*Currently eToroX only document integration with SignlaR client , soon eToroX will provide integration details with plain Websocket*

## Terminology
Phrase | Meaning
--- | --- 
Websocket protocol | The prefefined procedural methods of creating and maintaining a Websocket connection to eToroX servers , including frames and json fromats defined by SignalR.
Channel | A logical subject / source of information.
Event | A channel may stream multiple occourrences that have happened on a that specific channel.
Topic | A combination of a single channel and a single event.
Result | A single result or mutliple results from the same invokation.
Action | A method or a frame that should be sent by the user in order to achive a result.
Stream | An action that results in real time multiple on going results.
Subscription | A request for a stream of information, while the stream is a technical term for the infromation passed. the subscription is the logical term that defineds the streams.

## eToroX actions / streams

### Action - `setup`

eToroX streaming services are only allowed to identified users.
The `setup` action is preformed to prove to eToroX that the user of the Websocket is an identified user and that it has access to it's private key.

> Don't share your private keys! eToroX will never ask you to share or send your private keys

Authentication process is fully described by [eToroX authentication](authentication).

The `setup` action recives the following mandatory parameters as a single json fromatted key/value object:

Name | Value
--- | ---
`apiKey`:string | The token api key.
`nonce`:string | A unique UUID that was used when generating the signature.
`timestamp`:int | Unix timestamp that was used when generating the signature.
`signature`:string | The result of the signature process as described by [eToroX authentication](authentication)

### Stream - `subscribe`

A single websocket connection can maintain multiple streams of different channels and events.

The `subscribe` action adds to the current websocket session an additional stream of data of the requested channels and event.

> Client may invoke the `subscribe` action as many times as he whishes as long as the action passes the required validations.

The `subscribe` action recives the following mandatory fields as a json formatted key/value object:

Name | Value
--- | ---
`channels`:string[] | The list of channels to be added to the requested stream.
`event`:string | The name of the event to be selected from all channels to be added to the requested stream.

The following subscription request (Witout signalR request format):
```json
{
    "channels":["btcusdx"],
    "event": "orderbook"
}
```
Produces events like the following event (Witout signalR response format):
```json
{
    "name": "order_created",
    "market": "btcusdx",
    "volume": 11,
    "price": 0.23,
    //....// 
}
```

#### `subsribe` validations
* Multiple client subscriptions cannot be subscribed to the same topic (channel/event combination), if same topic will be requested more than once the `subscribe` request will fail.
* Each client subscriptions request should be from list of channels and thier events. if a topic that was not listed by eToroX or is not active will be requested the `subscribe` request will fail.
* If the optional field `fields` selector is sent than it must be ordered by an alphanumeric order.

#### Stream `fields` selector
In addition to the signalR formatted frames, eToroX servers returns a key/value json formatted object with all fields and data for each event.
While being very comfertable it significatlly increases bandwith.
It's most recomended to activate a `fields` selector when creating the desired stream.
As a result the client will recive the list of values he requested without the schema, client will be able to determine which of the values defines which property by the order he requested.

The `subscribe` action recives the following mandatory and optional `fields` selector, fields as a json formatted key/value object:

Name | Value
--- | ---
`channels`:string[] | The list of channels to be added to the requested stream.
`event`:string | The name of the event to be selected from all channels to be added to the requested stream.
`fields`:string[] | The list of fields to select from the event data.

The following subscription request (Witout signalR request format):
```json
{
    "channels":["btcusdx"],
    "event": "orderbook",
    "fields":["name" , "price" , "volume"]
}
```

Produces events like the following events (Witout signalR request format):
```json
["order_created" , 1.2 , 0.5]
```
> Notice the order of the values is ordered as the order of the requested fields in the subscription request.
